          Here at 4NEW, we are trying to grow the crypto-community in the most sustainable way, but we need your help to spread the word on our cause, which is why we reward you with a bonus for every new sign up of a friend that you refer!<br/>
          So how is 4NEW benefitting the crypto-community as well as the planet? We stop waste going to landfill, instead harnessing the energy within the waste in order to produce electricity. That electricity hosts mining facilities, helping to address the enormous (growing) energy consumption of blockchain technologies. Read more about it here at https://4new.io.<br/>
          Want to earn more bonus points? Refer another friend.
